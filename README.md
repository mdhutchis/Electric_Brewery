# Introduction
VSS 59 brewing uses an all-electric Brew-In-A-Bag (BIAB) setup. This method originated in Australia :australia: and is centered around using a single vessel for brewing. Efficiency is maintained by re-circulating the wort and precise temperature control is achieved with a RaspberryPi based controller. 

Many of the parts are custom designed and printed with a 3D printer; these parts are included in this repository for reference. Contributions are welcome; printed parts can be provided if desired.

## Random Parts
### Drip Tray
This is a little helper to keep beer from dripping out of the picnic taps. It prints in two pieces and then is assembled and hung on the picnic tap. Keeps the fridge clean, slide it to the side to pour a beer and it then neatly slides right back under the tap to catch any last drops.

## iSpindel
Finding just the right sized PET container can be a challenge when trying to fit standard [iSpindel](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel) sleds. 

The iSpindel sled below is customizable for any PET container that is large enough to fit the iSpindel hardware.
