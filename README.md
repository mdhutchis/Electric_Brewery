# VSS 59 Brewing
A collection of parts and helpers for the VSS 59 brewery setup.

## Random Parts
### Drip Tray
This is a little helper to keep beer from dripping out of the picnic taps. It prints in two pieces and then is assembled and hung on the picnic tap. Keeps the fridge clean!

## iSpindel
I was having trouble finding a PET container that fit the standard [iSpindel](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel) sleds that you can find on Thingiverse. I found one that was "almost" the right size but had to design a sled that would work with it. The .scad code is included so that you can customize it for your PET container.
